### Pytho
*You think you can't make good planets? Hold my beer..*

Pytho is the first (and only) planet pack I ever made. I created it in 2014, when Planet Factory was still *the* mod for making planets, and I was fairly bad at it. (Not that I cared, I did it for the fun of creating something new.)

Indirectly, this system is the reason for me taking up Kopernicus. When I saw Kopernicus and it's possibilities I *really* wanted to remake this in Kopernicus with better..., well, everything. However, I never had a chance to do that because Kopernicus kept me busy. And when I had time, I didn't want to make planets anymore.

Recently I found this only pack in my dropbox account (where I hosted it for some friends) and decided to update it to the newest Kopernicus, but **without any changes**. So that people can see, that even if their planets might be bad, it can still get worse. So it is more for the giggles (call it voluntary self-embaressment if you want), than to be used in an actual savegame (using it should be possible though, if you really want.)

P.S. Ok, I made one change. I removed one planet because that planet was a plain ripoff of Alternis Kerbols new Laythe. That didn't feel quite right.
