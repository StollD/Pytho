### Pytho
*You think you can't make good planets? Hold my beer..*

Pytho is the first (and only) planet pack I ever made. I created it in 2014, when Planet Factory was still *the* mod for making planets, and I was fairly bad at it. (Not that I cared, I did it for the fun of creating something new.)

Indirectly, this system is the reason for me taking up Kopernicus. When I saw Kopernicus and it's possibilities I *really* wanted to remake this in Kopernicus with better..., well, everything. However, I never had a chance to do that because Kopernicus kept me busy. And when I had time, I didn't want to make planets anymore.

Recently I found this only pack in my dropbox account (where I hosted it for some friends) and decided to update it to the newest Kopernicus, but **without any changes**. So that people can see, that even if their planets might be bad, it can still get worse. So it is more for the giggles, than to be used in an actual savegame (using it should be possible though, if you really want.)
